# dev-project-resource-allocation-helper
This is my undergrad's final project, to get my degree of Bachelor in Information Systems, back in 2015 (PUCRS, Brazil). It's a system that allows Project Managers to quickly identify the right members for a new Development project based on technical and soft skills. Unfortunately, all the documentation for this project is in Portuguese, but I'm working on a translated version.
